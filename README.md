# MAS.712 - Learning Creative Learning
## Spring 2018

This is the website used for the spring 2018 version of MAS.712 - Learning Creative Learning.

If you're a person from the future who wants to use/update this site: (a) greetings from the past! and (b) here are some notes that may or may not be helpful:

- The content for the site is primarily powered by Google Docs that are set as ["Published to the web"](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/37579?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en) and update automatically whenever anyone makes a change. The folder for the 2018 course is [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1B8qiwoTVGJcyIvC7O3lcfhsKQXDsnh8B) (you will need permissions to access it).
- The rest of the site is compiled into static pages using the [Jekyll framework](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- General CSS layout stuff is built on top of [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/)

- Create a new copy of this repository and rename it to 2019 (or whatever/whenever)
- In Google Drive, copy the "Classes" folder (and docs contained therein)
- In each of the newly copied Google Docs, set them up to [publish to the web](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/37579?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en)
- Replace the embed codes in the new repository with the embed codes from each respective Google Doc
- Deploy your new site somewhere where students can access it
